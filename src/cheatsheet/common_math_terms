The "mean" is the "average"
The "median" is the "middle" value in the list of numbers
The "mode" is the value that occurs most often. If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list.
The "range" of a list a numbers is just the difference between the largest and smallest values.



Find the mean, median, mode, and range for the following list of values:
13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13

mean: 15
median: 14
mode: 13
range: 8

The largest value in the list is 21, and the smallest is 13, so the range is 21 â€“ 13 = 8.
